### Self-introduction (text):
Hello. My name is Timur. I live in the Republic of Belarus in the city of Nesvizh. My city is as small as my current factory salary.
At the moment I'm studying and I want to become a front-end developer. By the way, I'm going to study all my life, because if we don't learn, we don't develop. 

Okay, let's move on.
I graduated from the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics with a degree in nanomaterials in electronics. 
I worked for 3 years in my specialty, but it did not bring me pleasure. Of the strengths I can note: attentiveness, perseverance, pedantry and a desire to learn. 

I also have some experience in marketing, namely: I learned how to create one-page sites and run an advertising campaign on social networks.

As soon as I got acquainted with the profession of a front-end developer, I immediately felt warm, as if I had been in the cold all day and lay down on a warm 
bed under a blanket. What do I like about this profession? I like to think, develop logic and apply it to technical tools. I love creating websites. This area 
infects me more and more with love. 

My plans for the next half of the year are to master all the course material and get my first job as a front-end developer. Thank you for your attention. Goodbye.
